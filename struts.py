struts.py

The Structural Primitives Module.

This file provides the low-level connective tissue (the "struts") that binds
the deterministic execution layer to the narrative and data layers. By isolating
these utilities here, we prevent the core logic from being polluted with repetitive
dictionary lookups, type-checking boilerplate, and raw string formatting.

def ux(section: str, key: str, default: Any = "") -> Any:
    """
    Retrieves localized, user-facing strings from the Lore cache.

    Architectural Intent (Pinker):
    Hardcoding dialogue or UI text directly into execution logic causes semantic rot.
    It makes the system rigid and impossible to iterate on cleanly. This function
    acts as the Lexical Firewall, ensuring that all narrative text is drawn from a
    centralized, easily modifiable manifest.

    Args:
        section (str): The specific narrative domain (e.g., 'warnings', 'greetings').
        key (str): The precise string identifier within that domain.
        default (Any): The fallback value if the key is missing. Defaults to "".

    Returns:
        Any: The requested narrative string, or the default if the lookup fails.

def ux_format(section: str, key: str, default: str = "", **kwargs) -> str:
    """
    Retrieves and safely interpolates dynamic variables into a UX string.

    Architectural Intent (Meadows):
    Systems fail. When a string template requires three variables but the payload
    only provides two, a standard `.format()` will crash the entire execution thread.
    This function prioritizes system resilience by gracefully degrading to the raw,
    unformatted string rather than triggering an apocalyptic stack trace for a typo.

    Args:
        section (str): The narrative domain.
        key (str): The string identifier.
        default (str): Fallback string.
        **kwargs: The dynamic variables to inject into the string template.

    Returns:
        str: The fully interpolated string, or the raw string if interpolation fails.

    Agnostic retriever for nested data structures.

    Architectural Intent (Schur):
    Python is dynamically typed, which means sometimes an object is a dictionary,
    and sometimes it's a class instance. Writing `if isinstance(obj, dict): ...`
    every time you want to check a property is bureaucratic nonsense. This primitive
    handles the routing automatically so the developer can just ask for the data.

    Args:
        obj (Any): The target object (can be a dict or a class instance).
        key (str): The property or key to retrieve.

    Agnostic setter for nested data structures, equipped with structural alarms.

    Architectural Intent (Fuller):
    Writing data to an object that has unexpectedly become `None` is a critical
    failure in tensegrity. It means a load-bearing strut is missing. Instead of
    swallowing the error silently or throwing a generic AttributeError, this
    function acts as a systemic smoke detector, explicitly warning the developer
    that the architecture is rotting.

    Args:
        obj (Any): The target object to modify.
