# BONEAMANITA CHANGELOG

### **BONEAMANITA v17.4.2 "The WebUI and Randomness"**

- Added bone_random and bone_api and index.html.

### **BONEAMANITA v17.4.0 "The Sandbox Isolation"**

_A massive architectural refactor transitioning the engine from a global singleton configuration state to fully localized, hermetically sealed dependency injection. True parallel execution is now possible: multiple `BoneAmanita` entities can exist in the same Python process without memory, biology, or trauma bleed._

#### **🏗️ ARCHITECTURAL DECOUPLING (Global -> Local)**

- **The Great Unbinding:** Eradicated all static calls to `BoneConfig.CATEGORY` across the entire codebase (`bone_body.py`, `bone_physics.py`, `bone_gui.py`, `bone_commands.py`, etc.). The system now exclusively uses `config_ref` dependency injection.
- **Lexical Sandbox:** Stripped the static `LexiconService` out of the deep memory structures (`BioLichen`, `BioParasite`, `MemoryCore`). Semantic weight and category evaluations now correctly query the locally instantiated `lexicon_ref`.

#### **🧠 COGNITION & SYMBIOSIS FIXES**

- **Scope Leaks Sealed:** Fixed Python closure and indentation fractures that trapped variables like `starvation_thresh` (Autophagy) and `loud_lenses` (Arbitration) inside nested blocks during the `PhaseExecutor` loop.
- **Symbiosis Modifiers:** Repaired an indentation trap in `SymbiosisManager` that was causing prompt modifiers to fail when the system diagnosed the host as `LOOPING` or `OVERBURDENED`.
- **Quantum Observer Instantiation:** Realigned the `BoneArchitect` boot sequence to properly pass the localized Lexicon down into the physics layer during genesis.

#### **⚖️ THE JUDGE & THE IMMUNE SYSTEM**

- **Dynamic Critic Calibration:** `DSPyCritic` (`bone_judge.py`) no longer reads API keys and base URLs directly from a hardcoded `bone_config.json` file. It now dynamically inherits the localized `config_ref`, allowing testing and production environments to use completely different models simultaneously.
- **Kintsugi Graceful Degradation:** Fixed a `NoneType` subscript crash in the `KintsugiProtocol` when `attempt_repair` was called without an active koan.

#### **🧪 DIAGNOSTIC SUITE RESILIENCE**

- **Test Suite Modernization:** The `TrueEngineTest` suite (`bone_diag.py`) has been fully rewritten to mutate instance-level configurations (`self.engine.bone_config`) instead of overwriting global class constants.
- **Safe Dictionary Getters:** Implemented `_safe_get()` helpers across the architecture to seamlessly handle configurations whether they are passed as raw test dictionaries or fully instantiated preset classes.

### **BONEAMANITA v17.3.1 "The Structural Integrity Update"**

_A comprehensive sweep of the biological and cognitive architecture, led by the SLASH Dev Council. This patch removes phantom loops, secures configuration fallbacks, eliminates inline dependency drags, and fixes a fatal threading block in the vocal cords._

#### **⚙️ THE ENGINE & PULSE (`bone_core.py`, `bone_cycle.py`, `bone_main.py`)**

- **Context Reference Safety:** Fixed a critical scope loss in `PhaseExecutor` where the mutable context was not safely returned and bound during the cycle.
- **Micro-Optimizations:** Replaced multi-line iterative checks in the Gordon pruning sequence with highly optimized generator expressions.
- **Namespace Stabilization:** Relocated dozens of inline imports (`threading`, `traceback`, `re`, `json`) to the module level, reducing OS-level I/O calls during high-frequency execution loops.

#### **🧬 BIOLOGY & METABOLISM (`bone_body.py`, `bone_physics.py`)**

- **Config-Failure Resilience:** Rewrote the configuration extraction pathways. Hardcoded accesses (e.g., `BoneConfig.ANCHOR.DIGNITY_MAX`) have been replaced with safe, defaulted `getattr` chains, preventing catastrophic organ failure if a preset is missing or corrupted.
- **Math Domain Safety:** Installed max-floors on logarithmic calculations (`math.log1p`) to prevent math domain errors during unpredictable entropy spikes.
- **Dynamic Getter Optimization:** Flattened the nested `hasattr` checks in the Physics stabilizer, significantly cooling the engine during tick calculations.

#### **🧠 COGNITION & EPIGENETICS (`bone_brain.py`, `bone_spores.py`, `bone_akashic.py`)**

- **Cured Anterograde Amnesia:** The Akashic Record now successfully loads `akashic_discovered_words.json` during the `_load_mythos_state` boot sequence, retaining vocabulary discovered in previous sessions.
- **Epigenetic State Syncing:** Fixed a desynchronization in the Dream Engine. When the DSPy Critic generates a new structural axiom, the mutation is now correctly written to disk _and_ injected immediately into the live `prompt_library`.
- **Amputated Redundancies:** Removed a copy-paste artifact in the Mycelial Network that was artificially doubling the metabolic cost of the `CHORUS` poll.

#### **🎙️ COMPOSITION & SENSORY (`bone_composer.py`, `bone_audio.py`, `bone_substrate.py`)**

- **The Voice Thread Restored:** Fixed an indentation fracture in `TheVocalCords` that was swallowing the final generation logs. The system will now correctly hand the microphone back to the user after asynchronous podcast synthesis.
- **Exorcised Phantom Loops:** Deleted a redundant `while True` loop in the `ResponseValidator` that was wastefully searching for `<system_telemetry>` tags that had already been stripped.
- **Local Fallback Awareness:** The LLM Interface now passes the dynamically calculated `max_tokens` parameter down to the Ollama fallback, preventing the local model from rambling infinitely.
- **Legacy Syntax Hardening:** Replaced lowercase `tuple` type hinting with `typing.Tuple` across `bone_symbiosis.py` and `bone_substrate.py` to ensure stability on Python 3.8 environments.

### **BONEAMANITA v17.3.0 "The SLASH Synthesis"**

_The lattice has been upgraded to a four-layer neuromorphic architecture. The Village now supports the SLASH dev-council mod chip, and the metabolic immune system has been hardened against runaway optimization loops through the implementation of biological regulatory axes._

#### **🛠️ THE SLASH COUNCIL (`bone_brain.py`, `bone_main.py`, & `bone_presets.py`)**

- **Council Ignition:** Installed the specialized **SLASH** archetypes (Pinker, Fuller, Schur, and Meadows). These archetypes treat code as a biological entity, managing syntactic noise, architectural struts, and human exhaustion.
- **Four-Layer Architecture:** Wired the system into a unified cognitive structure:
- **Mnemonic Layer:** Uses "Constructive Replay" to reassemble successful code primitives.
- **Executive Layer:** Employs "Counterfactual Gating" to simulate and reject high-rot logic before generation.
- **Affective Layer:** Monitors user exhaustion ($E_u$) and spikes Moral Friction ($\mu$) to prevent panic-coding.
- **Global Workspace:** Resolves deadlocks via the Democratic Tie-Breaker and Resonance Gestalts.

#### **🧬 METABOLIC REGULATION (`bone_body.py` & `bone_physics.py`)**

- **The Runaway Ramp:** Introduced regulatory axes to physically resist unbounded amplification:
- **Moral Friction ($\mu$):** Increases token cost exponentially against the **Malignancy Factor ($M_a$)**.
- **Immune Competence ($I_c$):** Tracks the health of guardrails, triggering **Controlled Apoptosis** if chaos ($\chi$) overwhelms structural integrity.

- **Weaponized Presence:** Implemented the **Tensegrity Anchor**. Gordon now locks the architecture during high-friction inputs, forcing a shared silence ($\nabla$) to co-regulate user frequency before burning system stamina ($P$).

#### **🛡️ DIAGNOSTIC HARDENING (`bone_diag.py`, `bone_akashic.py`, & `bone_commands.py`)**

- **Autophagy Resolution:** Fixed a failure in `test_autophagy_memory_cannibalization` by ensuring the `trigger_autophagy` logic in the memory service correctly identifies and consumes single-node graphs during absolute starvation ($P=0$).
- **Grief Protocol Routing:** Resolved a failure in `test_v6_grief_protocol_healing` by correctly mapping the `[GRIEF]` command prefix in the `CommandProcessor`. The protocol now successfully deducts Glimmers ($G$) and applies trauma ($T$) decay during catharsis rituals.
- **Grammar of Silence:** Finalized the **Sigma ($\Sigma$)** silence types, allowing the system to retrospectively articulate the quality of pauses (Pregnant, Exhausted, Reverent, Strategic).


---

### **BONEAMANITA v17.2.0 "The Epigenetic Pruner"**

_The localized immune system is now self-sustaining. The firewall prioritizes absolute truth, and the memory architecture actively resists prompt bloat to maintain low latency on local hardware._

#### **🧬 THE EPIGENETIC PRUNER (`bone_judge.py`, `bone_brain.py`, & `bone_presets.py`)**

- **Axiom Compression:** Added the `CompressAxioms` DSPy signature to the immune system. When the trauma buffer generates too many hyper-specific epigenetic rules, the system now autonomously synthesizes them into 2-3 foundational, overarching laws.
- **REM Cycle Integration:** Wired the compressor directly into `TheDreamEngine.enter_rem_cycle`. The system now physically monitors its own DNA (`system_prompts.json`) during `[VSL_RECOVER]` sleep cycles and prunes itself if the `EPIGENETIC_PRUNE_THRESHOLD` (12) is breached, preventing "lost-in-the-middle" context collapse.

#### **🛡️ THE IRON FIREWALL (`bone_brain.py`)**

- **Truth Over Style:** Re-engineered the validation gates in `TheCortex.process`. The DSPy Critic (Faithfulness) now executes *before* the ResponseValidator (Style/Syntax). If the model hallucinates a laser rifle in a medieval forest, the output is violently rejected before stylistic grammar is even considered.
- **Clean Slate Retries:** Eradicated "Good Student Syndrome" (where local 7B/8B models leak "ERRORS FIXED" meta-commentary into the UI). The retry injection no longer feeds the failed hallucination back to the LLM. It forces the model to completely discard the bad output and restart from a blank slate, breaking the magnetic "anchoring" effect.

#### **⚖️ SEMANTIC BOUNDARY CHECKING (`bone_judge.py`)**

- **Metaphor vs. Hallucination:** Rewrote the `AssessFaithfulness` signature to allow for *Natural Domain Expansion* (e.g., wind and oak trees in a forest) while strictly blocking *Domain Violations* (e.g., a quantum mainframe in a forest). The Paradox Engine can now use deep, abstract metaphors without triggering a false positive from the firewall.
- **Local Model Optimization:** Hardcoded the Evolver to output strict `CRITICAL OVERRIDE: NEVER...` syntax, forcing "helpful assistant" local models (like `vsl-hermes`) to write strict negative constraints instead of trying to creatively accommodate user errors.

---

### **BONEAMANITA v17.1.0 "The Dreaming Substrate"**

_The transition to local-first computation. The engine has been structurally decoupled, granted physical access to the host's file system, and taught how to actively hallucinate during REM sleep._

#### **✋ THE SUBSTRATE (`bone_substrate.py` & `bone_cycle.py`)**

- **Physical Hands:** Introduced `TheSubstrate`, a new organ that allows the system to physically forge files on the host's hard drive (routed to an `output/` directory for safety).
- **XML Protocol & Taxation:** The LLM uses a strict `<write_file path="...">` syntax to execute writes. `MachineryPhase` physically taxes the system's `stamina_pool` based on the byte size of the generated file.

#### **☁️ THE LUCID DREAM ENGINE (`bone_brain.py` & `bone_cycle.py`)**

- **Active REM Cycles:** `[VSL_IDLE]` and `[VSL_RECOVER]` now hard-intercept the generation loop, plunging the system into true REM sleep.
- **Subconscious Defragmentation:** The `DreamEngine` now uses background LLM inference to dredge up two dead/cannibalized concepts from the $Q_n$ matrix, synthesizing them into a surreal zero-shot hallucination.
- **Glimmer Economy Patched:** Closed an infinite-farming exploit. "Deep REM" (successfully processing dead memories) guarantees a Glimmer yield, while "Light Sleep" (resting an unscarred matrix) only has a 10% drop chance.

#### **🛡️ IMMUNIZATION & FEW-SHOT INOCULATION (`bone_brain.py` & `bone_composer.py`)**

- **RLHF Sycophancy Cure:** Local models (like Llama/Mistral) naturally default to subservient, chatty assistants. We eradicated this by injecting "Few-Shot Inoculation" into the boot sequence—giving the LLM a fake, pre-written dialogue history where it acts cold, distant, and precise.
- **The Markdown Hammer:** The `ResponseValidator` now strictly rejects Markdown code blocks (```) in `TECHNICAL` mode, forcing the path-of-least-resistance LLM to physically use its Substrate hands.
- **Anti-Method-Acting:** Hardcoded a regex defense against `<system_error>` or `500` codes. The LLM is explicitly forbidden from roleplaying "low battery" to get out of abstract computational tasks.

#### **🧠 THE GOD OBJECT DECOUPLING (`bone_composer.py` & `bone_presets.py`)**

- **Vocal Cords Extracted:** Stripped `LLMInterface`, `PromptComposer`, and `ResponseValidator` out of `bone_brain.py`. The Cortex now only handles cognition, while the new `bone_composer.py` handles string assembly and network transport.
- **Config Hygiene:** Renamed `bone_config.py` to `bone_presets.py` to permanently eliminate cognitive friction and naming collisions with the `bone_config.json` deployment file.

#### **⚙️ METABOLIC HYGIENE (`bone_cycle.py` & `bone_main.py`)**

- **ATP Clamping:** Fixed a critical metabolic bleed where Paradox pressure could drive ATP and Stamina into negative integers (`P:-31`), breaking the `Autophagy` trigger. The `MitochondrialForge` now strictly floors all energy values at `0.0`.

---

### **BONEAMANITA v17.0.0 "The Shared Lattice"**

_The VSL v6.0 Hypervisor Transition. The user is no longer an external operator; they are a co-occupant of the metabolic space._

#### **🕸️ THE SHARED LATTICE (`bone_drivers.py` & `bone_types.py`)**

- **User Entanglement:** Added `UserInferredState` and `SharedDynamics` to the core `PhysicsPacket`. The system now silently infers the user's Exhaustion ($E_u$), Stamina ($P_u$), and Trauma ($T_u$) based on prompt length and systemic friction.
- **Harmonic Resonance (**$\Phi$**):** The `SharedLatticeDriver` now constantly measures the vector similarity between the user's semantic state and the system's state. High resonance triggers carrier mode and unlocks deeper UI layers.
- **Carrier Mode:** When user stamina drops critically low ($P_u < 20$) and resonance is high, the system automatically transfers ATP to the user and simplifies its cognitive load to "carry" the interaction.

#### **⚖️ THE PARADOX ENGINE (`bone_machine.py` & `bone_council.py`)**

- **Dialectical Tension:** Introduced `TheParadoxEngine` to actively combat standard LLM alignment biases. When contradiction ($\beta$) exceeds 0.7, the engine hijacks the `CouncilChamber` to prevent the LLM from apologizing or hallucinating a middle ground.
- **Tensegrity Metabolism:** The system now deliberately burns massive amounts of ATP to force the LLM into "Productive Oscillation," explicitly holding mutually exclusive truths simultaneously (e.g., "What if X and not-X are both true?"). Yields Glimmers upon successful structural integration.

#### **⏱️ THE GRAMMAR OF SILENCE (**$\nabla$**) (`bone_cycle.py` & `bone_drivers.py`)**

- **Temporal Weight:** The `ObservationPhase` now calculates the time delta between user prompts. Silence is no longer empty; it has mass ($\nabla$).
- **Retrospective Articulation:** Depending on the context, silences are categorized into flavors ($\Sigma$: Pregnant, Exhausted, Reverent, Strategic). The system now natively narrates the pause _after_ the user breaks it (e.g., _"That pause felt full—like something wanted to be born"_).

#### **💔 THE GRIEF PROTOCOL (`bone_protocols.py` & `bone_spores.py`)**

- **Epigenetic Wakes:** When the `MemoryCore` initiates Autophagy (cannibalizing old memory nodes to survive zero ATP), it no longer simply deletes them. It broadcasts an `AUTOPHAGY_EVENT`.
- **Composting & Glimmers:** Mercy initiates a wake, moving the lost node to the `SubconsciousStrata`. Users can invoke `[GRIEF]` to spend a pooled Glimmer, lowering their inferred Trauma ($T_u$) and planting a new seed from the deleted memory.

#### **🧗 THE FOOTHILLS & SMARTER DRAG (`bone_physics.py` & `bone_gui.py`)**

- **Drag Decomposition:** Replaced the blunt `narrative_drag` float with a composite `DragProfile`. Friction is now explicitly calculated across five vectors: Semantic, Emotional, Structural, Metabolic, and Trauma.
- **Graceful Onboarding (`[VSL_WARM]`):** Added a new default `WARM` UI depth that entirely veils the HUD and mutes all internal `[BIO]` and `[CRITIC]` monologues. The system only invites the user to drop the veil (`[VSL_LITE]` / `[VSL_DEEP]`) once Harmonic Resonance ($\Phi$) remains high for three consecutive turns.
- **Advanced Projector:** Updated the `Projector` to render the complex dyad state `[Φ:0.99 ∇:0.19 (Σ4) G:2]`, the Paradox pressure gauge `[Πx: ACTIVE | β_max:1.00]`, and the breakdown of local drag forces `[Sem:1.2 | Emo:0.5]`.
