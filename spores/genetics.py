"""spores/genetics.py

This module defines the evolutionary and reproductive systems of the engine.
Instead of loading static configurations every time, the system can "reproduce"
by saving its current state as a Spore. These spores carry genetic mutations,
inherited trauma, and adapted vocabulary, allowing the system to evolve
new conversational metabolisms over successive generations.

Classes:
    - LiteraryReproduction: The biological controller for spawning offspring states
      (Mitosis) or merging two distinct session states (Crossover).
