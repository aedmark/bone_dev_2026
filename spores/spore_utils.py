This module contains the lowest-level mathematical and structural primitives of the engine.
It is pure, stateless geometry. These functions form the bedrock that allows the
Subconscious Matrices (M_t and Q_n) in memory.py to rotate, decay, and store semantic
meaning as multi-dimensional coordinates.
